## The process

The k0rdent initialization process involves tools such as Helm and FluxCD.

1. [helm install kcm](../quick-start/installation.md#installation-via-helm) brings up the bootstrap components (yellow on the picture above)
1. kcm-controller-manager sets up webhooks to validate its `CustomResource`s, then cert-manager handles the webhooks’ certificates
1. kcm-controller-manager generates `Release` object corresponding to the kcm helm chart version
1. kcm-controller-manager (or rather the [release-controller](https://github.com/k0rdent/kcm/blob/main/internal/controller/release_controller.go) inside it) generates template objects (`ProviderTemplate`/`ClusterTemplate`/`ServiceTemplate`) corresponding to a `Release` to be further processed
1. kcm-controller-manager generates a `HelmRelease` object for every template from p.3 (Important: it includes also kcm helm chart itself)
1. [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) (source-controller and helm-controller pods) reconciles the *HelmRelease* objects. In other words, it installs all the helm charts referred to in the templates.
**After this point, the deployment is completely controlled by Flux.**
1. kcm-controller-manager creates a `Management` object that refers to the above `Release` and the `ProviderTemplate` objects.
The `Management` object represents the k0rdent management cluster as a whole.
The management cluster Day-2 operations (such as [upgrade](admin-upgrading-kordent.md)) are  executed by manipulating the `Release` and `Management` objects.
1. kcm-controller-manager generates an empty ``AccessManagement` object. `AccessManagement` defines [access rules](../template/main.md/#template-life-cycle-management) for `ClusterTemplate`/`ServiceTemplate` propagation across user namespaces. Further `AccessManagement` might be edited and used along with admin-created `ClusterTemplateChain` and `ServiceTemplaitChain` objects.
