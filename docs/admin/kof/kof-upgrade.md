# Upgrading KOF

## Data Backup

Before migrating or upgrading, it's recommended to create a backup of your Victoria Logs and Victoria Metrics data. You can export the data from the regional cluster endpoints to local files using the following commands. Repeat the describe procedure for each of your regional cluster if needed.

1. Lookup the regional cluster configmap named `kof-<cluster-name>` in the `kcm-system` namespace on the management cluster.

```bash
kubectl get cm kof-<cluster-name> -n kcm-system
```

2. Note the `read_logs_endpoint`, `read_metrics_endpoint`, and other endpoints values from the configmap.
3. Ensure that you have enough free disk space (e.g. check the total used size of volumes allocated to your regional cluster). Victoria Logs/Metrics usually compress the data. Commands to fetch the data compress data too, but it stores data in a JSON line format, so requires 5 times more space.
4. Ensure the connectivity to the regional cluster (e.g. do it on the Mothership cluster that surely has connectivity). If you are using Istio service mesh, consider to run a container in the Mothership cluster with attached properly sized volume in the kof namespace for connectivity to regional cluster endpoints.
Check the k0rdent [cluster documentation](../clusters/deploy-cluster.md) to retrieve kubernetes configuration.

### Backup Victoria Metrics

To backup all metrics data to a local file (`victoria-metrics-backup.gz`):

```bash
curl -H 'Accept-Encoding: gzip' -sSN \
  -u "<username>:<password>" \
  <read_metrics_endpoint>/api/v1/export?reduce_mem_usage=1 \
  -d 'match[]={__name__!=""}' \
  > victoria-metrics-backup.gz
```

To restore all metrics to a regional cluster from a local file run:

Without Istio servicemesh:

```bash
KUBECONFIG=kubeconfig kubectl port-forward svc/vminsert-cluster 8480:8480 -n kof # use kubeconfig of regional cluster to import data

curl -H 'Content-Encoding: gzip' -sSX POST \
  -T victoria-metrics-backup.gz \
  http://localhost:8480/insert/0/prometheus/api/v1/import
```

With Istio servicemesh:

```bash
curl -H 'Content-Encoding: gzip' -sSX POST \
  -T victoria-metrics-backup.gz \
  http://<CLUSTER_NAME>-vminsert:8480/insert/0/prometheus/api/v1/import
```

- This command fetches all metrics from the old regional cluster and saves them as a gzip-compressed file.
- You can later use this file for migration or restoration by uploading it to the new cluster.

### Backup Victoria Logs

Before querying logs increase the "search.maxQueryDuration" value for the `kof-storage-victoria-logs-cluster-vlselect` deployment which is just a 30s by default and not enough to query all logs at one request.

```bash
KUBECONFIG=kubeconfig kubectl edit deployment/kof-storage-victoria-logs-cluster-vlselect -n kof # use kubeconfig of regional cluster to import data
```

Edit and save the deployment spec to add `search.maxQueryDuration` argument (remove it after you finish the backup).

```yaml
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - args:
        - --search.maxQueryDuration=24h
```

To backup all logs data to a local file (`victoria-logs-backup.gz`):

```bash
curl -H 'Accept-Encoding: gzip' -sSN \
  -u "<username>:<password>" \
  <read_logs_endpoint>/select/logsql/query \
  -d 'query=*' > victoria-logs-backup.gz
```


- This command fetches all logs from the old regional cluster and saves them as a gzip-compressed file.
- You can later use this file for migration or restoration by uploading it to the new cluster.

To restore all logs to a regional cluster from a local file run:

Without Istio servicemesh:

```bash

KUBECONFIG=kubeconfig kubectl port-forward svc/kof-storage-victoria-logs-cluster-vlinsert 9481:9481 -n kof # use kubeconfig of regional cluster to import data

curl -H 'Content-Encoding: gzip' -sSX POST \
  -T victoria-logs-backup.gz \
  http://localhost:9481/insert/jsonline
```

*N.B.* the default `write_logs_endpoint` ends with `/insert/opentelemetry/v1/logs`: replace it with `/insert/jsonline`.

With Istio servicemesh:

```bash
curl -H 'Content-Encoding: gzip' -sSX POST \
  -T victoria-logs-backup.gz \
  http://<CLUSTER_NAME>-logs-insert:9481/insert/jsonline
```

**Notes:**
- Replace `<username>:<password>`, `<read_metrics_endpoint>`, `<read_logs_endpoint>`, etc with your actual credentials and endpoints (lookup the `storage-vmuser-credentials` secret in the `kof` namespace for basic authentication credentials if you are not using Istio servicemesh)
- For chunked or filtered backups, refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-logs) for available query options.
- Ensure you have sufficient disk space for the backup files.

## Data migration to a new regional cluster

This section describes the process for migrating data to a new KOF regional cluster, including both the cluster migration steps and the detailed procedure for migrating Victoria Logs and Metrics data.

### Migration Overview

1. **Deploy a new kof-regional cluster.**
2. **Add `k0rdent.mirantis.com/kof-regional-cluster-name` label** to a child ClusterDeployment to point all collectors to the new regional cluster.
3. **Ensure metrics and logs are available** for the child cluster, confirming the new regional cluster is operational.
4. **Change all other child clusters** from the old regional cluster to the new one.
5. **Start the data migration.**
6. **Ensure that the data is migrated and explorable in Grafana**
7. **Delete old kof-regional cluster**
8. **Remove the label from child ClusterDeployments.**

### Victoria Logs and Metrics Data Migration

Follow these steps to migrate Victoria Logs and Metrics data from the old regional cluster to the new one:

1. **Lookup the old regional cluster configmap** named `kof-<cluster-name>` in the `kcm-system` namespace on the management cluster.
2. **Note the `read_logs_endpoint` and `read_metrics_endpoint` values** from the configmap.
3. **Authentication and Service Mesh:**
    - If **not using Istio servicemesh**:
        - Lookup the `storage-vmuser-credentials` secret in the `kof` namespace for basic authentication credentials.
    - If **using Istio servicemesh**:
        - Copy the `istio-remote-secret-<cluster-name>` secret from the old regional cluster to the new regional cluster to enable Istio endpoints discovery.
4. **Prepare a migration environment** on the new regional cluster:
    ```bash
    KUBECONFIG=regional-kubeconfig kubectl run -it --rm \
      --image=alpine:latest -n kof migration -- sh

    apk update
    apk add curl pv
    ```
5. **Migrate metrics data** by running the following command (replace placeholders as needed):
    ```bash
    curl -H 'Accept-Encoding: gzip' -sSN \
      -u "<username>:<password>" \
      <read_metrics_endpoint>/api/v1/export?reduce_mem_usage=1 \
      -d 'match[]={__name__!=""}' \
      | pv | curl -H 'Content-Encoding: gzip' -sSX POST -T - \
      http://vminsert-cluster.kof:8480/insert/0/prometheus/api/v1/import
    ```

    Check [VictoriaMetrics API](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/url-examples/#apiv1export) for more details.

    The query fetches all metrics from the old regional cluster endpoint. If you need to split migration by chunks, please refer the documentation for `match[]` filter available options (by metric name, time range, etc)

    Reset vmselect cache after the migration:
    ```bash
    curl -I http://vmselect-cluster.kof:8481/internal/resetRollupResultCache
    ```

6. **Migrate logs data** by running the following command (replace placeholders as needed):
    ```bash
    curl -H 'Accept-Encoding: gzip' -sSN \
      -u "<username>:<password>" \
      <read_logs_endpoint>/select/logsql/query \
      -d 'query=*' \
      | pv | curl -H 'Content-Encoding: gzip' -sSX POST -T - \
      http://kof-storage-victoria-logs-cluster-vlinsert.kof:9481/insert/jsonline
    ```

    Check [VictoriaLogs FAQ](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/faq/#how-to-export-logs-from-victorialogs) for more details.

    The query fetches all logs from the old regional cluster endpoint. If you need to split migration by chunks, please refer the documentation for `logsql` query filter available options (by stream name, time range, etc)

To migrate data with transformation please consider one of the following options:

* Backup data to a file with a JSON line format, change each json, restore the file to a new cluster
* Use the [Python script](https://github.com/k0rdent/kof/tree/main/scripts/victoria-migration) with your custom transformation function

**Explanation of curl parameters:**

- `-H 'Accept-Encoding: gzip'`: Requests gzip-compressed response to reduce bandwidth.
- `-sS`: Silent mode. Hides progress, shows error messages.
- `-N`: Disables output buffering, streaming data as it arrives.
- `-u "<username>:<password>"`: Specifies basic authentication credentials (not needed for Istio)
- `-d 'match[]={__name__!=""}'`: Sends POST data to filter all metrics.
- `| pv`: Pipes output through `pv` to monitor progress.
- Second `curl`:
  - `-H 'Content-Encoding: gzip'`: Informs the server that the data is gzip-compressed.
  - `-X POST`: Uses HTTP POST method.
  - `-T -`: Reads data from stdin (the pipe) and uploads it.

**Notes:** Ensure you have the correct credentials and endpoints for your environment. Adjust the commands as necessary for your authentication method and network setup.

## Upgrade to any version

* Create a backup of each KOF chart values in each cluster, for example:
    ```bash
    # Management cluster uses default KUBECONFIG=""
    for cluster in "" regional-kubeconfig child-kubeconfig; do
      for namespace in kof istio-system; do
        for chart in $(KUBECONFIG=$cluster helm list -qn $namespace); do
          KUBECONFIG=$cluster helm get values -n $namespace $chart -o yaml \
            > values-$cluster-$chart.bak
        done
      done
    done
    ls values-*.bak
    ```
* Ideally, [create a backup](../backup/index.md) of everything including VictoriaMetrics/Logs data volumes.
* Open the latest version of the [Installing KOF](kof-install.md) guide.
* Make sure you see the expected new version in the top navigation bar.
* Apply the guide step by step, but:
    * Skip unchanged credentials like `external-dns-aws-credentials`.
    * Before applying new YAML files, verify what has changed, for example:
        ```bash
        diff -u values--kof-mothership.bak mothership-values.yaml
        ```
    * Run all `helm upgrade` commands with the new `--version` and files as documented.
* Do the same for other [KOF guides](index.md#guides).
* Apply each relevant "Upgrade to" section of this page from older to newer.
    * For example, if you're upgrading from v1.1.0 to v1.3.0,
    * first apply the [Upgrade to v1.2.0](#upgrade-to-v120) section,
    * then apply the [Upgrade to v1.3.0](#upgrade-to-v130) section.

## Upgrade to v1.5.0

> NOTE:
> To use the new [KCM Regional Clusters](../regional-clusters/index.md) with KOF, please apply the [KCM Region With KOF](kcm-region.md) guide on top of the steps below.

**Important!!!**

> NOTICE:
> This is for users of **kof-istio** only.

Starting from the **v1.5.0** release, Istio has been moved to a separate repository, which changes the installation and upgrade process. Upgrading KOF **will trigger a complete uninstallation** of all components across Istio clusters. To prevent data loss and ensure a smooth migration, you must carefully follow the steps in the given order. Again, the steps below are only required if any Istio clusters were deployed.

### 1. Back Up Data from Istio Clusters

> NOTE:
> Perform all backup steps in this section **for each Istio cluster** individually. Each cluster must have its own backup before proceeding with the upgrade.

#### Create a PersistentVolumeClaim

Create a `PersistentVolumeClaim` named `backup-pvc` on the management cluster:

```yaml
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: backup-pvc
  namespace: kof
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi # Adjust according to your data size
  storageClassName: standard
EOF
```

> NOTE:
> To estimate how much storage you need for the backup, open the [kof-ui](./kof-using.md#access-to-the-kof-ui), navigate to the `VictoriaMetrics/Logs` section, and click the `VictoriaMetrics storage` pod name on the cluster you want to back up. Find the `Data Size` metric and multiply this value by at least two (or by at least five for VictoriaLogs). This is because the metric shows data compressed using the VictoriaMetrics algorithm, while the backup will be stored in a simple gzip format, which does not compress as efficiently.

#### Create a Backup Pod with `curl`

Deploy a temporary pod for performing backups on the management cluster:

```yaml
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: backup-deployment
  namespace: kof
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: backup-deployment
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: backup-deployment
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: backup
        image: curlimages/curl:latest
        command: ["/bin/sleep", "infinity"]
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /home/curl_user
          name: backup-volume
      volumes:
      - name: backup-volume
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: backup-pvc
EOF
```

#### Retrieve Cluster Endpoints

Locate the regional cluster `ConfigMap` named `kof-<cluster-name>` in the `kcm-system` namespace of the management cluster.

Record the following endpoint values:

* read_logs_endpoint
* read_metrics_endpoint

#### Connect to the Backup Pod

```bash
kubectl exec -it -n kof <BACKUP_DEPLOYMENT_POD_NAME> -- /bin/sh
```

#### Back Up VictoriaMetrics/Logs Data

For instructions on creating backups of VictoriaMetrics and log data, refer to the [Data Backup](#data-backup) section.

#### (Optional) Download Backups Locally

```bash
kubectl cp -n kof <BACKUP_DEPLOYMENT_POD_NAME>:victoria-metrics-backup.gz ./victoria-metrics-backup.gz
kubectl cp -n kof <BACKUP_DEPLOYMENT_POD_NAME>:victoria-logs-backup.gz ./victoria-logs-backup.gz
```

### 2. Clean Up the Old Istio Clusters

> IMPORTANT:
> Ensure that both `VictoriaMetrics` and `VictoriaLogs` backup files have been successfully created and verified before the cluster cleanup.

#### Pause Synchronization on Managed Clusters

Before starting the cleanup, execute the following command on the management cluster:

```bash
kubectl scale --replicas=0 deployment/addon-controller -n projectsveltos
```

This command temporarily pauses synchronization between the management cluster and all managed clusters. It ensures that no old configurations are applied during the cleanup process.

#### Cleanup Old KOF Components

Use the `kof-nuke.bash` script (located in the `kof/script` directory) to completely remove all old `kof` resources from the remote cluster.

Run the script for each **regional** and **child** cluster, for example:

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=regional-kubeconfig && ls $KUBECONFIG && scripts/kof-nuke.bash
```

Cleanup typically takes 1–5 minutes, depending on the cluster size and network speed.

#### Cleanup Old Istio Components

Remove old Istio components for each **regional** and **child** cluster

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=regional-kubeconfig

helm uninstall --wait -n istio-system kof-istio-gateway
helm uninstall --wait -n istio-system kof-istio
helm uninstall --wait -n istio-system cert-manager
kubectl delete namespace istio-system --wait
kubectl get crd -o name | grep --color=never 'istio.io' | xargs kubectl delete
```

Once the cleanup of all regional and child clusters is complete,
run `unset KUBECONFIG` to use the **management** cluster in the next steps.

### 3. Remove the Old Istio Chart

Remove the old Istio release and related resources from the management cluster:

```bash
helm un -n istio-system kof-istio
kubectl delete namespace istio-system --wait
kubectl get crd -o name | grep --color=never 'istio.io' | xargs kubectl delete
```

### 4. Deploy New Istio Release

Install the new Istio release to the management cluster.

#### Install the `k0rdent-istio-base` Chart

```bash
helm upgrade -i --wait \
  --create-namespace -n istio-system k0rdent-istio-base \
  --set cert-manager-service-template.enabled=false \
  --set injectionNamespaces="{kof}" \
  oci://ghcr.io/k0rdent/istio/charts/k0rdent-istio-base --version 0.1.0
```

**Notes:**

* `cert-manager-service-template.enabled=false` disables the deployment of the cert-manager service template. It should already be deployed as part of KOF.
* `injectionNamespaces="{kof}"` ensures Istio sidecars are injected only into the `kof` namespace. To inject sidecars into additional namespaces, list them comma-separated: `{kof,<YOUR_NAMESPACE>}`.

#### Install the `k0rdent-istio` Chart

```bash
helm upgrade -i --wait -n istio-system k0rdent-istio \
  --set cert-manager-service-template.enabled=false \
  --set "istiod.meshConfig.extensionProviders[0].name=otel-tracing" \
  --set "istiod.meshConfig.extensionProviders[0].opentelemetry.port=4317" \
  --set "istiod.meshConfig.extensionProviders[0].opentelemetry.service=kof-collectors-daemon-collector.kof.svc.cluster.local" \
  oci://ghcr.io/k0rdent/istio/charts/k0rdent-istio --version 0.1.0
```

### 5. Upgrade the KOF Version

Upgrade KOF to the target version following standard upgrade procedures.

### 6. Restart the KOF Pods

You must restart the KOF pods on the management cluster to update the `istio-proxy` sidecar. Without restarting, you may encounter connection errors or Istio pod crashes.

```bash
kubectl delete pod --all -n kof
```

**Notes:**

* If you have additional namespaces with Istio sidecar injection, make sure to restart pods in those namespaces as well.
* Restarting ensures all pods run with the updated Istio configuration and sidecar versions.

### 7. Resume Sveltos Synchronization

Resume synchronization between the management cluster and all managed (regional and child) clusters.

Run the following command on the management cluster:

```bash
kubectl scale --replicas=1 deployment/addon-controller -n projectsveltos
```

### 8. Add New Labels to ClusterDeployment

To enable Istio on your clusters, you need to add two new labels to the corresponding ClusterDeployment resources.

* `k0rdent.mirantis.com/istio-role: member` - Apply this label to СlustersDeployment where Istio should be installed.
* `k0rdent.mirantis.com/istio-gateway: "true"` - Apply this label only to regional clusters to install Istio gateway.

### 9. Restore Data

Use the backup created in step 2 to restore VictoriaMetrics and VictoriaLogs data.

#### Connect to the Backup Pod

```bash
kubectl exec -it -n kof <BACKUP_DEPLOYMENT_POD_NAME> -- /bin/sh
```

#### Restore VictoriaMetrics/Logs Data

Follow the restore steps in the [Data Backup](#data-backup) section to import backups into VM/VL.

## Upgrade to v1.4.0

* `PromxyServerGroup` CRD was moved from the `crds/` directory to the `templates/` directory for auto-upgrade.
* Please use `--take-ownership` on upgrade of `kof-mothership` to 1.4.0:
    ```bash
    helm upgrade --take-ownership \
      --reset-values --wait -n kof kof-mothership -f mothership-values.yaml \
      oci://ghcr.io/k0rdent/kof/charts/kof-mothership --version 1.4.0
    ```
* This will not be required in future upgrades.

## Upgrade to v1.3.0

Before upgrading any helm chart:

* If you have customized [VMCluster or VMAlert resources](https://github.com/k0rdent/kof/blob/v1.2.1/charts/kof-mothership/values.yaml#L169)
    then update your resources accordingly to the [new values under "spec"](https://github.com/k0rdent/kof/blob/v1.3.0/charts/kof-mothership/values.yaml#L167).

* If you have customized VMCluster/VMAlert resources using the "k0rdent.mirantis.com/kof-storage-values" cluster annotation, then keep the old but put new values first to reconcile the new `ClusterDeployment` configuration on the current release, **then** run the helm charts upgrade. After regional clusters have the new `kof-storage` helm chart installed, you can remove old values from the cluster annotation.
* If you have set `storage` values of the `kof-regional` chart, update them in the same way.

* If you are not using [Istio](kof-install.md#istio),
    then on the step 8 of the [Management Cluster](kof-install.md#management-cluster) upgrade
    please apply this temporary workaround for the [Reconciling MultiClusterService](https://github.com/k0rdent/kcm/issues/1914) issue:
    ```bash
    kubectl rollout restart -n kcm-system deploy/kcm-controller-manager
    ```

## Upgrade to v1.2.0

* As part of the KOF 1.2.0 overhaul of metrics collection and representation, we switched from the [victoria-metrics-k8s-stack](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/victoria-metrics-k8s-stack) metrics and dashboards to [opentelemetry-kube-stack](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-helm-charts/tree/main/charts/opentelemetry-kube-stack) metrics and [kube-prometheus-stack](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack) dashboards.
* Some of the previously collected metrics have slightly different labels.
* If consistency of timeseries labeling is important, users are advised to conduct relabeling of the corresponding timeseries in the metric storage by running a retroactive relabeling procedure of their preference.
* A possible reference solution here would be to use [Rules backfilling via vmalert](https://victoriametrics.com/blog/rules-replay/).
* The labels that would require renaming are these:
    * Replace `job="integrations/kubernetes/kubelet"` with `job="kubelet", metrics_path="/metrics"`.
    * Replace `job="integrations/kubernetes/cadvisor"` with `job="kubelet", metrics_path="/metrics/cadvisor"`.
    * Replace `job="prometheus-node-exporter"` with `job="node-exporter"`.

Also:

* To upgrade from `cert-manager-1-16-4` to `cert-manager-v1-16-4`
    please apply this patch to management cluster:
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
    apiVersion: k0rdent.mirantis.com/v1beta1
    kind: ServiceTemplateChain
    metadata:
      name: patch-cert-manager-v1-16-4-from-1-16-4
      namespace: kcm-system
      annotations:
        helm.sh/resource-policy: keep
    spec:
      supportedTemplates:
        - name: cert-manager-v1-16-4
        - name: cert-manager-1-16-4
          availableUpgrades:
            - name: cert-manager-v1-16-4
    EOF
    ```

---

## Upgrade to v1.1.0

* After you `helm upgrade` the `kof-mothership` chart, please run the following:
    ```bash
    kubectl apply --server-side --force-conflicts \
    -f https://github.com/grafana/grafana-operator/releases/download/v5.18.0/crds.yaml
    ```
* After you get `regional-kubeconfig` file on the [KOF Verification](./kof-verification.md) step,
  please run the following for each regional cluster:
    ```bash
    KUBECONFIG=regional-kubeconfig kubectl apply --server-side --force-conflicts \
    -f https://github.com/grafana/grafana-operator/releases/download/v5.18.0/crds.yaml
    ```
* This is noted as required in the [grafana-operator release notes](https://github.com/grafana/grafana-operator/releases/tag/v5.18.0).
