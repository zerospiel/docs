# Using and Creating ServiceTemplates: Creating and Deploying Applications

Deploying an application, like deploying a cluster, involves applying a template to the management cluster. Rather than a `ClusterTemplate`, however, applications are deployed using a `ServiceTemplate`.

You can find more information on [Bringing Your Own Templates](../../reference/template/template-byo.md)
in the Template Guide, but this section gives you an idea of how to create a `ServiceTemplate`
and use it to deploy an application to a {{{ docsVersionInfo.k0rdentName }}} child cluster.

`ServiceTemplate` supports the following types as a source:

- [`HelmChart`](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/source/helmcharts/)
- [`GitRespository`](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/source/gitrepositories/)
- [`Bucket`](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/source/buckets/)
- [`OCIRepository`](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/source/ocirepositories/)
- `Secret`
- `ConfigMap`

### Creating Helm-based ServiceTemplate

> NOTE:
> Only [`HelmRepository`](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/source/helmrepositories/) support as a source for `HelmChart`.

Define the source of the Helm chart that defines the service. The source object must have the label `k0rdent.mirantis.com/managed: "true"`. For example, this YAML describes a FluxCD source object of `kind` `HelmRepository`:

```yaml
apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1
kind: HelmRepository
metadata:
  name: custom-templates-repo
  namespace: kcm-system
  labels:
    k0rdent.mirantis.com/managed: "true"
spec:
  insecure: true
  interval: 10m0s
  provider: generic
  type: oci
  url: oci://ghcr.io/external-templates-repo/charts
```

#### Create the `ServiceTemplate`

A template can either define a Helm chart directly using the template's `spec.helm.chartSpec` field or reference its location using the `spec.helm.chartRef` field.

For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: k0rdent.mirantis.com/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceTemplate
metadata:
  name: project-ingress-nginx-4.11.3
  namespace: my-target-namespace
spec:
  helm:
    chartSpec:
      chart: ingress-nginx
      version: 4.11.3
      interval: 10m0s
      sourceRef:
        kind: HelmRepository
        name: k0rdent-catalog
```

In this case, we're creating a `ServiceTemplate` called `ingress-nginx-4.11.3` in the
`my-target-namespace` namespace.  It references version 4.11.3 of the `ingress-nginx` chart
located in the `k0rdent-catalog` Helm repository.

For more information on creating templates, see the [Template Guide](../../reference/template/index.md).

### Creating Kustomization-based ServiceTemplate

Define the source of the Kustomization that defines the service. If the source object is one of Flux source - `GitRepository`, `Bucket` or `OCIRepository` - it must
have the label `k0rdent.mirantis.com/managed: "true"`.

Source object can be already created. In this case `.spec.kustomization.localSourceRef` should be used:

```yaml
apiVersion: k0rdent.mirantis.com/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceTemplate
metadata:
  name: kustomization-app
  namespace: kcm-system
spec:
  kustomize:
    localSourceRef:
      kind: GitRepository
      name: project-x
    deploymentType: Remote
    path: "./base"
```

Aside from flux sources, local `ConfigMap` or `Secret` object can be used as a source of the kustomization manifests. The `ServiceTemplate` definition will not differ
from one in above, except the `.spec.kustomize.localSourceRef.kind` which should be set to respective object type. However, to use `ConfigMap` or `Secret` as a source, they must
embed archive with kustomization. After the archive was created, this can be done by executing the following command:

```shell
kubectl create configmap kustomization-source --from-file=/path/to/kustomization.tar.gz
```

Another option is to let the controller to create the remote source object. In this case `.spec.kustomization.remoteSourceSpec` should be used:

```yaml
apiVersion: k0rdent.mirantis.com/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceTemplate
metadata:
  name: kustomization-app
  namespace: kcm-system
spec:
  kustomize:
    remoteSourceSpec:
      oci:
        url: oci://ghcr.io/org/project-x
        reference:
          tag: latest
        interval: 10m
    deploymentType: Remote
    path: "./overlays"
```

When `.spec.kustomize.remoteSourceSpec` is defined, the controller will create corresponding object.

### Creating Raw-Resources-based ServiceTemplate

This type of source is quite similar to the kustomization sources, with the only exception: 
when using `ConfigMap` or `Secret` as a source, the field `.spec.resources.localSourceRef.path` will be ignored 
and the resources' manifests to be deployed must be inlined in the source's `data`.

Example of the `ConfigMap` and corresponding `ServiceTemplate`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: project-cm
  namespace: project-x
data:
  namespace.yaml: |
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Namespace
    metadata:
      name: managed-ns
```

To create such `ConfigMap` the following command can be used:

```shell
kubectl --namespace project-x create configmap project-cm --from-file=/path/to/namespace.yaml
```

```yaml
apiVersion: k0rdent.mirantis.com/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceTemplate
metadata:
  name: managed-ns
  namespace: project-x
spec:
  resources:
    localSourceRef:
      kind: ConfigMap
      name: project-cm
    deploymentType: Remote
    path: ""  # will be ignored
```

Using the remote source for `ServiceTemplate` based on raw resources is similar to the kustomization-based template:

```yaml
apiVersion: k0rdent.mirantis.com/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceTemplate
metadata:
  name: kustomization-app
  namespace: kcm-system
spec:
  resources:
    remoteSourceSpec:
      git:
        url: https://github.com/org/project-x.git
        reference:
          branch: main
        interval: 10m
    deploymentType: Remote
    path: "./overlays"
```

### Deploying Application with ServiceTemplate

#### Create a `ServiceTemplateChain`

To let {{{ docsVersionInfo.k0rdentName }}} know where this `ServiceTemplate` can and can't be used, create a `ServiceTemplateChain` object, as in:

 ```yaml
 apiVersion: k0rdent.mirantis.com/v1alpha1
 kind: ServiceTemplateChain
 metadata:
   name: project-ingress-nginx-4.11.3
   namespace: my-target-namespace
 spec:
   supportedTemplates:
     - name: project-ingress-nginx-4.11.3
     - name: project-ingress-nginx-4.10.0
       availableUpgrades:
         - name: project-ingress-nginx-4.11.3
 ```

Here you see a template called `project-ingress-nginx-4.11.3` that is meant to be deployed in the `my-target-namespace` namespace.
The `.spec.helm.chartSpec` specifies the name of the Helm chart and where to find it, as well as the version and other
important information. The `ServiceTempateChain` shows that this template is also an upgrade path from version 4.10.0.

If you wanted to deploy this as an application, you would first go ahead and add it to the cluster in which you were
working, so if you were to save this YAML to a file called `project-ingress.yaml` you could run this command on the management cluster:

 ```shell
 kubectl apply -f project-ingress.yaml -n my-target-namespace
 ```

#### Adding a `Service` to a `ClusterDeployment`

To add the service defined by this template to a cluster, you would simply add it to the `ClusterDeployment` object
when you create it, as in:

 ```yaml
 apiVersion: k0rdent.mirantis.com/v1alpha1
 kind: ClusterDeployment
 metadata:
   name: my-cluster-deployment
   namespace: tenant42
 spec:
   config:
     clusterLabels: {}
   template: aws-standalone-cp-{{{ extra.docsVersionInfo.providerVersions.dashVersions.awsStandaloneCpCluster }}}
   credential: aws-credential
   serviceSpec:
     services:
       - template: project-ingress-nginx-4.11.3
         name: ingress-nginx
         namespace: my-target-namespace
     priority: 100
 ```
As you can see, you're simply referencing the template in the `.spec.serviceSpec.services[].template` field of the `ClusterDeployment`
to tell {{{ docsVersionInfo.k0rdentName }}} that you want this service to be part of this cluster.

If you wanted to add this service to an existing cluster, you would simply patch the definition of the `ClusterDeployment`, as in:

 ```shell
 kubectl patch clusterdeployment my-cluster-deployment -n my-target-namespace --type='merge' -p '{"spec":{"serviceSpec":{"services":[{"template":"project-ingress-nginx-4.11.3","name":"ingress-nginx","namespace":"my-target-namespace"}]}}}'
 ```
