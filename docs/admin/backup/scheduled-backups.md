# Scheduled Management Backups

Backups should be run on a schedule consistent with the policy requirements of the environment. For example a production environment might be set for "daily" backups, while a testing environment is set for "weekly".

## Preparation

> NOTE: 
> The following instructions are tailored for AWS. Please adapt them to your chosen platform and storage.

Before you create a manual one-off or scheduled backup, review the steps below and update your configuration accordingly:

1. Verify whether the `velero` plugins have been installed as suggested in [Velero installation](customization.md#velero-installation). If the `velero` plugins with the desired [storage option](https://velero.io/docs/v1.15/supported-providers/) are already configured, please skip the next step.

1. If no `velero` plugins have yet been installed in your k0rdent cluster, start by getting the kcm management yaml file:

    ```sh
    kubectl get management kcm -n kcm-system -o yaml > management.yaml
    ```
    then edit the `management.yaml` file so that the velero plugin details are filled in under `spec.core.kcm`:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: k0rdent.mirantis.com/v1alpha1
    kind: Management
    metadata:
      name: kcm
    spec:
      # ... 
      core:
        kcm:
          config:
            velero:
              initContainers:
              - name: velero-plugin-for-<PROVIDER-NAME>
                image: velero/velero-plugin-for-<PROVIDER-NAME>:<PROVIDER-PLUGIN-TAG>
                imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
                volumeMounts:
                - mountPath: /target
                  name: plugins
      # ...
    ```

    Please review [Velero's Docker Hub image plugin repositories](https://hub.docker.com/u/velero?page=1&search=velero-plugin)
    to help identify the required `<PROVIDER-NAME>`.
    Once the required image has been identified, select from the available tags to determine the correct
    `<PROVIDER-PLUGIN-TAG>`. In the case of AWS, the provider-name would be `velero-plugin-for-aws`, we can
    select from the [available tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/velero/velero-plugin-for-aws/tags).

1. Prepare a [storage location](https://velero.io/docs/v1.15/supported-providers/), such as an Amazon S3 bucket, to store {{{ docsVersionInfo.k0rdentName }}} backups.

1. Prepare a yaml file containing a [`BackupStorageLocation`](https://velero.io/docs/v1.15/api-types/backupstoragelocation/)
   object referencing a `Secret` with credentials to access the cloud storage
   (if the multiple credentials feature is supported by the plugin). For example, you can create the `BackupStorageLocation` and the related `Secret` yaml for the Amazon S3 configuration by following these steps.

      First create a file called `credentials.txt` with your credentials, as in:

      ```console
      [default]
      aws_access_key_id = EXAMPLE_ACCESS_KEY_ID
      aws_secret_access_key = EXAMPLE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
      ```

      The IAM user being used in this configuration will require certain permissions for the
      appropriate Velero S3 bucket access. Review the necessary permissions [here](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero-plugin-for-aws?tab=readme-ov-file#option-1-set-permissions-with-an-iam-user)
      (reference the JSON policy file named `velero-policy.json` -- take care to replace `${BUCKET}` with the
      correct bucket name).

      Generate the necessary base64-encoded credentials using:
      ```sh
      base64 -w0 credentials.txt; echo
      ```

      Use this base64 value in the `data.cloud` field in the `creds-and-backup-storage-location.yaml` you'll create next. Also make sure to substitute the appropriate `REGION-NAME` and `BUCKET-NAME`:
      ```yaml
      ---
      apiVersion: v1
      data:
        # base64-encoded credentials for Amazon S3 in the following format:
        # [default]
        # aws_access_key_id = EXAMPLE_ACCESS_KEY_ID
        # aws_secret_access_key = EXAMPLE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
        cloud: <BASE64_VALUE>
      kind: Secret
      metadata:
        name: cloud-credentials
        namespace: kcm-system
      type: Opaque
      ---
      apiVersion: velero.io/v1
      kind: BackupStorageLocation
      metadata:
        name: aws-s3
        namespace: kcm-system
      spec:
        config:
          region: <REGION-NAME>
        default: true # optional, if not set, then storage location name must always be set in ManagementBackup
        objectStorage:
          bucket: <BUCKET-NAME>
        provider: aws
        backupSyncPeriod: 1m
        credential:
          name: cloud-credentials
          key: cloud
      EOF
      ```

1. Create the necessary Kubernetes resources in your k0rdent cluster by applying the YAML to the management cluster:
    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f creds-and-backup-storage-location.yaml
    kubectl apply -f management.yaml
    ```
1. Confirm that the previous steps were applied correctly:
    ```sh
    kubectl get management kcm -n kcm-system -o yaml
    ```
    The management configuration yaml should have the new velero plugin details, as shown in step 2. 

    Now make sure the `backupstoragelocation` shows as `Available`:
    ```sh
    kubectl get backupstoragelocation -n kcm-system
    ```
    ```console
    NAME     PHASE       LAST VALIDATED   AGE   DEFAULT
    aws-s3   Available   27s              2d    true
    ```
You can get more information on how to build these objects at the [official Velero documentation](https://velero.io/docs/v1.15/locations).

## Create a Management Backup

Periodic backups are handled by a `ManagementBackup` object, which uses a [Cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) expression
for its `.spec.schedule` field.
If the `.spec.schedule` field is not set, a [backup on demand](./ondemand-backups.md#management-backup-on-demand) will be created instead.

Optionally, set the name of the `.spec.backup.storageLocation` of the `BackupStorageLocation` object.
The default location is the `BackupStorageLocation` object with `.spec.default` set to `true`.

For example, you can create a `ManagementBackup` object that backs up to the storage object
created in the [preparation step](#preparation) every 6 hours
(ref: [Kubernetes CronJob schedule syntax, "Vixie cron" step values](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/#schedule-syntax)). Create a YAML file called `scheduled-backup.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: k0rdent.mirantis.com/v1alpha1
kind: ManagementBackup
metadata:
  name: kcm
spec:
  schedule: "0 */6 * * *"
  storageLocation: aws-s3
EOF
```
Start the scheduled backup process by applying the YAML to the cluster:
```sh
kubectl apply -f scheduled-backup.yaml
```
Confirm the backup creation was successful by navigating to the appropriate storage console UI or from the command line:
```sh
kubectl get managementbackup
```
The `managementbackup` should show as `Completed`:
```console
NAME              LASTBACKUPSTATUS   NEXTBACKUP   AGE
example-backup    Completed                       8m  
```
