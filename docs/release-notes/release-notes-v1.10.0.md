## Highlights

* **Policy and Security Controls Expanded**: This release adds audit policy support and template-level etcd encryption
configuration, making it easier to align clusters with security and compliance requirements from day one.

* **Service Lifecycle Management Is More Predictable**: `ServiceSet` and `MultiClusterService` behavior is improved
with clearer deployed/total visibility, better status persistence, and support for keeping already deployed services
when selectors change.

* **Default Templates Configuration Is More Robust**: Default template fixes (including missing MachineDeployment versioning,
OpenStack floating IP pool references, and defaults merging) plus chart updates (such as `priorityClassName` and
topology spread constraints) reduce configuration drift and deployment failures.

* **Operational Stability and Controller Efficiency Improved**: Reconcile path optimizations, namespace-watch filtering,
semver-based version comparison, lower controller noise and improve convergence behavior.
