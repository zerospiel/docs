# Using a Private Secure Registry to deploy K0rdent

## Prerequisites

If you are deploying K0rdent with registry overrides (see
[Configuring a Custom OCI Registry for KCM components](appendix-extend-mgmt.md#configuring-a-custom-oci-registry-for-kcm-components)),
and your registry endpoint is secured with a certificate signed by an unknown Certificate Authority (CA), you must
ensure that the CA certificate is trusted by your management cluster nodes before deploying K0rdent.

To do this, add the CA certificate to the system’s trust store on each management cluster node.

### For Management Clusters Running on k0s

Before starting the k0s controller, do the following:

1. Copy the CA certificate file (e.g., `<PATH_TO_CA_CERT>`) to the system’s trusted certificate directory:

    ```bash
    sudo cp <PATH_TO_CA_CERT> /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
    ```

2. Update the system’s trusted certificates:

    ```bash
    sudo update-ca-certificates
    ```

3. Proceed to install k0s as usual

### For Management Clusters Running on Kind

1. Create a Kind configuration file that mounts the CA certificate into the container nodes.
Suppose your CA certificate is located at `<PATH_TO_CA_CERT>` on your host.

    ```yaml
    # kind-config.yaml
    kind: Cluster
    apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
    nodes:
      - role: control-plane
        extraMounts:
          - hostPath: <PATH_TO_CA_CERT>
            containerPath: /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/registry-ca.crt
    ```

2. Create the Kind cluster using the configuration:

    ```bash
    kind create cluster --config kind-config.yaml --name <KIND_CLUSTER_NAME>
    ```

3. Run the following command to update the trust store inside the container. Repeat this command for each node in the
Kind cluster, replacing `<KIND_CLUSTER_NAME>-control-plane` with the name of the Docker container representing that
node:

    ```bash
    docker exec <KIND_CLUSTER_NAME>-control-plane update-ca-certificates
    ```
