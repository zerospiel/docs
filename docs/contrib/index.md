# k0rdent Documentation Contributor's Guide

The k0rdent community relies on contributions both for code and documentation.
As community members you can be particularly helpful by pointing out areas where
the documentation can be improved, either in terms of corrections or additions.
In addition, we are happy to accept contributions.
